# flask-practice

## Description
I made this repo to self-learn and try new things with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

## Content
The repo and its dependencies are managed within a simple `virtualenv flask-practice` command. The files are distributed to appropriate directories so that Flask can "see".

## Assets
* Template: [Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty)
